## About
I wanted to better familiarize myself with full-stack and MERN stack development.
Using my prior knowledge of front-end web development, I used the most current framework, React.js.
I also have prior experince with SQL and MySQL but I decided that utilizing MongoDB and their services will make this project run smoother.
